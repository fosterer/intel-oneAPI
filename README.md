## Step-by-Step Code Execution Instructions:
  This Section must contain set of instructions required to clone and run the prototype, so that it can be tested and deeply analysed
  
## What I Learned:
   + We explored a range of Intel's software development tools and libraries, including the AI analytics toolkit and its libraries.
   + Using IntelÂ® AI Analytics Toolkits we were able to enhance performance speed in training data.
   + Brainstormed with novel algorithms for different kinds of object detection specific to autonomous vehicles.
   + Implemented Object detection alongwith distance mapping of nearby objects in order to prevent collisions.
   + We've been able to custom label/annotate the objects in detection.
   + The AI analytics toolkit is a set of libraries and tools that can be used for machine learning and data analytics.
   + By leveraging the AI analytics toolkit and SYCL/DPC++ libraries, developers can write code that is optimized for the Intel hardware platform. This can help to speed up development time, improve performance, and enable developers to tackle more complex problems.
